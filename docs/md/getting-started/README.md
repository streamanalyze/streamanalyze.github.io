# Getting started

This section describes how to get started using sa.engine. 

Usually the system is accessed though [sa.studio](visual-analyzer.md), which is a simple graphical interface to sa.engine that enable fast and convenient development of data stream models. sa.studio provides a **REPL** (Read-Eval-Print-Loop) where OSQL expressions are interactively specified and immediately executed. Furthermore, sa.studio allows the results of evaluating OSQL expressions to be visualized in real-time in various formats in a web browser. You are recommended to continue with the [sa.engine Tutorial](../tutorial/README.md) once you have installed sa.studio and familiarized yourself with its basic functionality.

An alternative is to use the [Console REPL](console-REPL.md), which is a textual command line interface to sa.engine for accessing the system from OS shells and regular text editors.
