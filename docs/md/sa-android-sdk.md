## sa.android SDK

The **sa.android SDK** provides a powerful toolkit for development of complete Android apps in Java to analyze data streams from sensors in real-time. The SDK enables apps to send continuous queries to an sa.engine system running on an Android device and process the result stream. The sa.android system includes a fast main-memory object-oriented database for Android apps. The SDK together with  **[sa.studio](getting-started/visual-analyzer.md)** is a powerful development environment for mobile real-time stream analytics on Android devices.

The sa.android SDK provides predefined data stream interfaces to data stream sources available on most Android devices, such as the microphone, the GPS, and the gyroscope. The data stream interfaces enable real-time analyses of data streams from these sources in continuous queries. Furthermore, with the sa.android SDK data stream interfaces to new kinds of data streams and sensors can be developed.

The sa.android SDK is based on the sa.engine Java API. To get started, please read the instructions and documentation in the provided documents **sa_Android_2.0.docx** and **sa_JavaAPI_2.2.docx**.
