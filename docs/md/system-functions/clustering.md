# Clustering

Functions can be *clustered* by creating multiple result stored
functions, and then each individual function can be defined as a
derived function.

For example, to cluster the properties name and
address of persons one can define:

```sql
   create function personprops(Person p) -> (Charstring name,Charstring address)
     as stored;

   create function name(Person p) -> Charstring nm
     as select nm
          from Charstring a
         where personprops(p) = (nm,a);
 
   create function address(Person p) -> Charstring a
     as select a
          from Charstring nm
         where personprops(p) = (nm,a);
```

Clustering does not improve the execution time performance
significantly. However, clustering can decrease the database size
considerably.
