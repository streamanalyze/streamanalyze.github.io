This section describes the built-in functions per subject.

## Comparison operators

The built-in, infix comparison operators are:

```
=(Object x, Object y) -> Boolean   (infix operator x = y)
!=(Object x, Object y) -> Boolean  (infix operator x != y)
>(Object x, Object y) -> Boolean   (infix operator x > y)
>=(Object x,Object y) -> Boolean   (infix operator x >= y)
<(Object x, Object y) -> Boolean   (infix operator x < y)
<=(Object x,Object y) -> Boolean   (infix operator x <= y)
```
Examples:
```
5 < 10

"Jim" >= "Bill"
```
