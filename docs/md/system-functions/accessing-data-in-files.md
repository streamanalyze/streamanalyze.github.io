## Accessing Data in Files

The file system where an sa.engine server is running can be accessed with a number of system functions:

The function `pwd()` returns the path to the current working directory of the server:
```
pwd() -> Charstring path
```

The function `cd()` changes the current working directory of the server:
```
cd(Charstring path) -> Charstring
```

The function `dir()` returns a bag of the files in a directory:
```
dir() -> Bag of Charstring file
dir(Charstring path) -> Bag of Charstring file
dir(Charstring path, Charstring pat) -> Bag of Charstring file
```

The first optional argument `path` specifies the path to the directory. The second optional argument `pat` specifies a regular expression (as in like) to match the files to return. The function `file_exists()` returns true if a file with a given name exists:
```
file_exists(Charstring file) -> Boolean
```

The function `directoryp()` returns true if a path is a directory:
```
directoryp(Charstring path) -> Boolean
```

The function `filedate()` returns the write time of a file with a given name:
```
filedate(Charstring file) -> Date
```

### Reading and writing files

The function `readlines()` returns the lines in a file as a bag of strings:
```
readlines(Charstring file) -> Bag of Charstring
readlines(Charstring file, Charstring sep) -> Bag of Charstring
```
The optional second argument `sep` specifies the character used to separate the lines. The default is the standard line separator.

The function `csv_file_tuples()` reads a CSV (*Comma Separated Values*) file. Each line is returned as a vector.

For example, if a file named *myfile.csv* contains the following lines:
```
1,2.3,a b c
4,5.5,d e f
```
the result from the call `csv_file_tuples("myfile.csv")` is a bag containing these vectors:
```
[1,2.3,"a b c"]
[4,5.5,"d e f"]
```

The CSV reader can, e.g., read CSV files saved by EXCEL, but is has to be in **English** format.

The function `read_ntuples()` imports data from a text file of space separated values. Each line of the text file produces one vector in the result bag. Each token on a line will be parsed into field in the vector. Numbers in the file are parsed into numbers. All other tokens are parsed into strings.
```
read_ntuples(Charstring file) -> Bag of Vector
```

For example, if a file name `test.nt` contains the following:
```
"This is the first line" another word
1 2 3 4.45 2e9
"This line is parsed into two fields" 3.14
```
the call `read_ntuples("test.nt")` returns a bag with the following vectors:
```
["This is the first line","another","word"]
[1,2,3,4.45,2000000000.0]
["This line is parsed into two fields",3.14]
```

The function `csv:write_file()` writes the vectors in a bag `b` into a file in CSV (Comma Separated Values) format so that it can loaded into, e.g., Excel.
```
csv:write_file(Charstring file, Bag b) -> Boolean
```
For example, the following statement:
```
csv:write_file("myoutput.csv", bag([1,"a b",2.2],[3,"d e",4.5])
```
produces the a file `myoutput.csv` having these lines:
```
1,a b,2.2
3,d e,4.5
```

The function `write_ntuples()` writes a bag of vectors into a files as space separated tokens in lines so that they can be read again with `read_ntuples()`:
```
write_ntuples(Bag of Vector rowset, Charstring file) -> Charstring
```
