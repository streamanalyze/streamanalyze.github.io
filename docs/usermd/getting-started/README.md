# Community Edition Guides
These getting started guides will walk you through the steps of signing up and getting started with SA Studio. They should give you the basics needed for starting with Streaming Edge Analytics using SA Engine and Studio.

Some of the guides will have prerequisite reads, if this is the case a note box like the one below will inform you of it.

All of these are already supported for Enterprises and paying customers.

These are some of the connectors available to use for extracting results from
SA Studio into an external system. We are currently working on making these
extenders open source and well documented for the community to play around with.

1. Connect to a MQTT broker for publishing of query result (Coming soon)
2. Connect to a Kafka broker for publishing of query result (Coming soon)
3. Creating your own extender to import/export data (Coming soon)

### Connecting SA Studio to external databases

All of these are already supported for Enterprises and paying customers.

4. Connect to an RDBMS using JDBC (Coming later).
5. Connect to Mongodb (Coming later)
