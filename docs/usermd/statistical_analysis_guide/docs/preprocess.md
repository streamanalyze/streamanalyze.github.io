# Pre processing.

The first step of any project with Analytics/ML/AI should be to make sense of the dataset. In this Pre processing tutorial you will learn how to visualize data sets, do some basic statistics over it. You will learn how you can use SA Engine to make sense of the data and should hopefully be able to reason out what models could fit this dataset afterwards.
