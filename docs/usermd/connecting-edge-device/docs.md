# Connecting an edge device

To be able to monitor sensor streams and deploy models to a device you first need to connect the device to a server. Connecting an edge device is generally comprised of three steps.

1. Download and install the SA Engine edge client on the device.
2. Start SA Engine on the device.
3. Execute a connect query on the device.

To connect a device you go to the Devices tab in SA Studio. Under “Get started” you can select the platform you want to connect, and you get step-by-step instructions on how to connect your specific device to the server.

You can also [connect the device manually](/DL/docs/usermd/connecting-edge-device/connect-manually.md), but it is recommended to use the interactive instructions under Devices → "Get started" in SA Studio.
