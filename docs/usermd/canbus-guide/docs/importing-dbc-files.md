# Importing DBC files

In this guide we will use a sample J1939 DBC file `j1393.dbc` that is a slightly altered version of the demo file provided in [this introduction to CAN DBC files](https://www.csselectronics.com/pages/can-dbc-file-database-intro).

First of all we need to load the CANBUS system model that contains all SA Engine functions for working with CAN bus data.

>[note] **Note:** You can disregard any `JSON.parse` errors that might arise.

```LIVE
load_system_model("canbus");
```

Then we start by translating the DBC file to our SA Engine CANBUS wrapper OSQL format.

```LIVE
can:import_dbc(sa_home() + "models/canbus-guide/j1939.dbc",
               sa_home() + "models/canbus-guide/j1939_dbc.osql",
               []);
```

The query translates the sample J1939 DBC file and stores the result in `j939_dbc.osql`:

```
/* CAN frame 0x0CF00400 BO_ 2364539904 */
create can:signal (name, cid, fid, decoder, params, options) instances
  ("EEC1_EngineSpeed", 0, 0x0CF00400, #'can:unpack_scale',['Z24u16', 0.125, 0],{"min":0,"max":8031.875});
/* CAN frame 0x18FEF100 BO_ 2566844672 */
create can:signal (name, cid, fid, decoder, params, options) instances
  ("CCVS1_WheelBasedVehicleSpeed", 0, 0x18FEF100, #'can:unpack_scale',['Z08u16', 0.00390625, 0],{"min":0,"max":250.996});
```

We see that the OSQL file contains two CAN signals "EEC1_EngineSpeed" and "CCVS1_WheelBasedVehicleSpeed".
Now that we have an OSQL definition of the DBC file we can simply load it.

```LIVE
load_osql(sa_home() + "models/canbus-guide/j1939_dbc.osql");
```

>[warning] **Important:** Loading the same signal definitions multiple times with `load_osql(<osql-dbc-file>)` result in "Violating unique index for name(Signal s)->Charstring" errors. To prevent this you can delete previously loaded signals with `delete_objects(select cs from can:signal cs)` before loading signal definitions.

To verify that the signals were defined we can list all signals and see that "EEC1_EngineSpeed" and "CCVS1_WheelBasedVehicleSpeed" are present in the output.

```LIVE
signals();
```
